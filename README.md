# Pachex (A React Chrome Extension Boilerplate)

## Features

This is a basic Chrome Extensions boilerplate to help you write modular and modern Javascript code, load CSS easily and [automatic reload the browser on code changes](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#automatic-refresh).

- [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-overview/)
- [React 18](https://reactjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Webpack Dev Server 4](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)
- [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- [Tailwind V3](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [eslint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## Getting Started

1. `git clone https://github.com/MahdiTa97/pachex.git`
2. `cd pachex`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`
5. open `chrome://extensions` url and turn on developer mode from top left and then click; on `Load Unpacked` and select the `build` folder.

## Scripts

- `start`
- `build`
- `prettier`

## Publishing

After the development of your extension run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.

## TypeScript

This boilerplate now supports TypeScript! The `Options` Page is implemented using TypeScript. Please refer to `src/pages/Options/` for example usages.

## Content Scripts

Although this boilerplate uses the webpack dev server, it's also prepared to write all your bundles files on the disk at every code change, so you can point, on your extension manifest, to your bundles that you want to use as [content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts), but you need to exclude these entry points from hot reloading [(why?)](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate/issues/4#issuecomment-261788690). To do so you need to expose which entry points are content scripts on the `webpack.config.js` using the `chromeExtensionBoilerplate -> notHotReload` config. Look the example below.

Let's say that you want use the `myContentScript` entry point as content script, so on your `webpack.config.js` you will configure the entry point and exclude it from hot reloading, like this:

```js
{
  …
  entry: {
    myContentScript: "./src/js/myContentScript.js"
  },
  chromeExtensionBoilerplate: {
    notHotReload: ["myContentScript"]
  }
  …
}
```

and on your `src/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://www.google.com/*"],
      "js": ["myContentScript.bundle.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Secrets

If you are developing an extension that talks with some API you probably are using different keys for testing and production. Is a good practice you not commit your secret keys and expose to anyone that have access to the repository.

To this task this boilerplate import the file `./secrets.<THE-NODE_ENV>.js` on your modules through the module named as `secrets`, so you can do things like this:

_./secrets.development.js_

```js
export default { key: '123' };
```

_./src/popup.js_

```js
import secrets from 'secrets';
ApiCall({ key: secrets.key });
```

:point_right: The files with name `secrets.*.js` already are ignored on the repository.
